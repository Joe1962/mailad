#############################################################################
#                 DEFAULT MAIL DOMAIN CONFIGURATION
#############################################################################

### Target Domain
# This is the FQDN of the domain
#
DOMAIN=mailad.cu

### Mail server's names
# This is the full qualified distinguished name of the PC
# you pretend to deploy the script
#
# The config points are /etc/hostname and /etc/hosts
# if they are not configured properly you will get a
# warning
#
HOSTNAME=mail.mailad.cu

### Real mail account of the mail administrator
# This is a requirement in the RFC as postmaster @ abuse
# address must point to a valid address an we use that
#
# You will receive all sort of warnings, errors and
# other notifications from the mail server, you can use
# a specific address for this and another for your
# personal us
#
ADMINMAIL=pavelmc@mailad.cu

### Sysadmin list
# If you have more than one sysadmin or a team that take turns
# to work, then you want to get them via a group and not only
# to the ADMINMAIL configured above
#
# Set the group email you want to use in the var below if you
# want to enable that feature, be aware that you need to create
# the group for it to work (you will receive remainders)
#
# See the Features.md file for more details [SysAdmins part]
#
# By default this options is empty
#
SYSADMINS=

### Background Copy Carbon
# If you set an address here that account will receive a copy
# of all mails passing by for monitoring purposes, yes
# that's a law requirement in Cuba
#
# Let if blank if you don't need that
#
# If will use this feature, please create the account before
# hand as it will start to receive mails from the start
#
ALWAYSBCC=

### Max size of the emails
# In MBytes, it will be calculated in bytes inside, the
# calculations have a 8% margin for headers and attachments
# expansion to be safe
#
MESSAGESIZE=2

### My Networks
# This are the IP or networks that are fully trusted by the server, 
# beside localhost & 127.0.0.1 that are already covered and you
# don't need to put them here
#
# Any PC with an IP in this range can send email without password auth
# and without restrictions, even to the outside world, this is useful
# for DMZ status mails from other servers via plain SMTP.
# 
# NEVER put the user's network here, NEVER!
#
# Also don't put here the mail gateway if you use it.
#
# Use "quotes" around it and split multiple entries with a comma and
# space, like this "10.0.0.0/24, 172.16.0.0/27"
#
# WARNING!: If you have a webmail (roundcube/rainloop/horde/etc)
# be aware that if the IP of the the webmail falls under the net
# segment declared here it will bypass all restrictions, ALL
# RESTRICTIONS!
#
# To exclude one or more IPs from a subnet you can use the '!' operator
# for example to exclude the IP 192.168.1.5 from the 192.168.1.0/27
# range you can put it like this:
#
# "!192.168.1.5, 192.168.1.0/27"
#
# You can use more than one IP, but exclusions must be declared before
# the network segment, not before
#
MYNETWORK="10.42.0.0/29"

### Mail Gateway or SmartHost
# If you have a mail gateway between you and the internet or if you
# are in a national/global enterprise network and need to deliver
# to a specific mail server for relaying to the outside world, then
# you must set this to that ip
#
# Use "[]" if it's and IP to avoid DNS resolution.
# 
# If your deliver the mails directly to the destination servers
# leave it blank
#
# Proxmox Mail Gateway note: remember that PMG uses port 26 for the
# outgoing mails, to append ":26" to the IP or hostname
#
RELAY=

### Mail user owner
# As we use a virtual mailbox domain we need a user to be the
# owner of all the mails, usually you don't need touch this
#
VMAILNAME=vmail
VMAILUID=5000
VMAILGID=5000

### Local mail storage
# This is the folder that will hold the mailbox folders for the users
# you can mount this as another partition, a NFS share, etc.
# 
# If you use a networks mount point be aware of the id mappings
#
# Our advice is to make it work with a local folder first, then
# stop the services and mount the share 
#
VMAILSTORAGE="/home/vmail"

### Everyone account
# In some cases you need an aliases that covers all the mail
# account registered on the server, some mail servers call it
# the everyone account, here you can name it as your need
#
# Please set it like this example, let the @$DOMAIN part, just
# change the everyone part
#
#EVERYONE="todos@mailad.cu"
#
# If you don't need this leave it blank like this
#
EVERYONE=

### Make the everyone address accessible from outside
# The address you set as the everyone alias by defaults is not
# accessible from the outside world as a security measure
#
# That means it only works inside your domain, if you need to
# be able to use it from the outside se this to "yes"
#
# options: yes/no (default no, case matters!)
EVERYONE_ALLOW_EXTERNAL_ACCESS=no

### Dovecot sieve filtering
# Per user mail filtering is enabled by default
#
# If you enable this feature all mails marked as SPAM will be
# automatically moved to the Trash Folder up on reception
#
# Please keep in mind that a user using POP3 (discouraged)
# may never see that message, to enable the filter and avoid
# the mentioned quirk, please stop using POP3 and use IMAP
# instead
#
# options: yes/no (default no, case matters!)
DOVECOT_SPAM_FILTER_ENABLED=no

### SSL/TLS for LDAP communications
# Select whether SSL/TLS will be used with LDAP communications
#
# Samba 4 AD can use SSL/TLS out of the box but Windows AD can't
# for this reason the default will be NOT to use a security layer
# for ldap communications.
#
# If you use a Windows AD and want to use SSL/TLS please read the
# corresponding entry on the Features.md file for instructions
#
# Set it to "yes" if you use SAMBA 4 as the AD DC
# Set it to "no" if you use Windows AD DC
#
# options: yes/no (default no, case matters!)
SECURELDAP=no

### AD LDAP user bind credentials
# As we need to search and validate against the AD, we use a set of
# fixed credentials to bind to it, se AD_Requirements.md
#
# This is a normal user, not and admin, no extra priv are needed
# just make it sure you checked the "Account never expires" flag

#                       MAIL FILTERING OPTIONS
#############################################################################

### Active SPAM blocking via DNSBL and other tricks
# DNS Black Listing is a trick to use free community created and curated
# lists of known spam generating domains, the most reputed one is "Spamhaus"
# 
# This variable is to enable or disable the use of DNSBL, if you are in a
# national VPN and your mails are delivered via a transport that relays the
# real internet emails for you, then it's not recommended to activate it.
#
# Other way of explain it: this will only be helpful is you are receiving
# the emails directly from the internet.
#
# Warning! some of this list servers have a query quota, if you use a public
# and very common DNS server (like 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4, aka GOOGLE) it may
# flag false positives!
#
# There is not only DNSBL when you activate this, there is a list or other
# tricks that activates some extra measures:
# - Pipelining
# - Pre greet message
# - Bare new line in the communication
# - Disable verify command
# - No auth is allowed over port 25
#
# options: yes/no (default no, case matters!)
ENABLE_DNSBL=no

### List of DNSBL services
# This is the var that represent the "postscreen_dnsbl_sites" in postfix
# please check the postfix manual to know more.
#
# We fill it wby default with the most ranked/used free lists out there,
# can add/remove more to fill your needs, they are just one line and split
# by ", "
#
# NOTICE: the threshold level is 2, that means that it must be flagged in
# two servers or in the case of spamhaus just once (notice the *2)
#
DNSBL_LIST="zen.spamhaus.org=127.0.0.[2..11]*2, psbl.surriel.com, bl.spamcop.net, bl.spameatingmonkey.net"

### Enable SPF filtering
# SPF filtering (Sender Policy Framework) is a useful trick
# to validate the origin of the emails.
#
# But it must be only enabled in a internet facing mail server,
# if you mail server is behind a mail gateway or a smart host
# or any other configuration that means that you don't get
# the emails from outside world directly from the other server
# you MUST DISABLE IT
#
# options: yes/no (default no, case matters!)
ENABLE_SPF=no

### Enable antivirus filtering
# If you set MailAD directly to the internet you need to
# configure an AV solution, in the other hand if you configure
# a mail gateway with proper AV filtering duplicating the
# efforts if worthless
#
# Never the less is UP TO YOU in your particular setup the
# AV activation or not, but if you do, please make sure
# the DNS on this PC works fine, you cab check it by running:
#
# dig +short TXT current.cvd.clamav.net
#
# you must receive something like this:
#
# "0.103.0:59:25931:1600392540:0:63:49191:331"
#
# We will setup ClamAV off by default
#
# Simply set the var here and configure the next steps if
# needed, keep reading below, you are not done!
#
# options: yes/no (default no, case matters!)
ENABLE_AV=no

### ClamAV mirror to use
# If you are in Cuba you can't get direct updates for ClamAV,
# you need to use an alternate mirror because the USA embargo
#
# state there if you need to use an alternate mirror
#
# Also see below for the option related to PROXY if needed
#
# options: yes/no (default yes, case matters!)
USE_AV_ALTERNATE_MIRROR=yes

### ClamAV Alternate mirror options
# This is the list we had compiled from working servers from
# Cuba, this list may change and we will try to keep it updated
# we provide more than one as some may be banned in a upstream
# proxy or so, also you can add your own local/enterprise
# clamav repository
#
# The mirrors will be used in the order shown below from start
# to end, if the first works the rest will never be used
#
# NOTICE!: this is a single line with URL separated by a space
# ans surrounded by double quotes "like this" 
#
AV_ALT_MIRRORS="http://mirror.webtastix.net/clamav http://103.230.76.202/clamav http://mirrors.mediatemple.net/freshclam http://repo.virtualhosting.hk/clamavdb"

### SpamAssassin config
# The spam filtering is a nice feature but it's not enabled
# by default as it requires extra work; to activate it and
# to squeeze all of it's performance you need some extra
# steps, please refers to the Features.md file
#
# Also see below for the option related to PROXY if needed
#
# options: yes/no (default no, case matters!)
ENABLE_SPAMD=no

### Use of proxy server to get updates from the internet
# some services like the AV and the Spamd need to get the
# updates from the internet, if you access to the outside
# world then set the configs and credentials here
#
# If your proxy has no user auth just let the user/password
# vars empty
#

#
# options: yes/no (default no, case matters!)
ENABLE_DISCLAIMER=no

### Whether disclaimer must reach local users
#
# You can change the scope of the disclaimer here, we can call for two main
# scenarios:
#
# - Add it to all mails generated in my domain, allowing the disclaimer to
# reach local domain users ("yes" value below)
# - Add it to all mails generated in my domain and going outside it, so no
# local domain user will see the disclaimer ("no" option below) 
#
# By default we set it to yes, so local users will see the disclaimer
#
# options: yes/no (default yes, case matters!)
