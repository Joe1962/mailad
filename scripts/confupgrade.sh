#   - Warn the user about a new features or config var he need to know

# load the actual confver
source ./mailad.conf

# store it on another var and erase it
NCONFVER=$CONFVER
unset CONFVER

# load the one on the file
source /etc/mailad/mailad.conf

# compare
if [ "$CONFVER" == "$NCONFVER" ] ; then
    # Same version, no upgrade needed
    echo "===> Same version, no upgrade needed"
