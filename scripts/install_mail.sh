# Goals:
#   - Check if there is pkgs already installed and warn & fail
#   - otherwise install the pkgs
#
# Notice: You need to provide a line like this after a success
#    echo "done" > install
#
# And not doing that after failure, that way it will not install on a unknown distro

# load the conf file
source /etc/mailad/mailad.conf
source common.conf

# this is the list to handle, will load it from the specific OS below
PKGS=""

# loading the os-release file
if [ -f /etc/os-release ] ; then
    # import the file
    source /etc/os-release

    ## Distros check
